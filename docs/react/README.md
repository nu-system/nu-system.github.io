## What?

'react-[component]' is mainly responsible for the Login Only section. Try not to be showy in this, just do the logic part.



If you are using a CSS solution, create an additional 'CSS -[component]' component for the corresponding presentation style and the corresponding skin.



If you're using a css-in-js solution, you need to define your UI interface and skin extensions within the component.

## Builder

`react-[component]`  build with [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb/blob/master/docs/guides/ReactComponents.md#developing-react-components-and-libraries-with-nwb)
